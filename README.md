# Python Project for Data Science - `Coursera`

Final Project: Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard


This project, the culmination of my journey through the Python Project for Data Science course on Coursera, extends far beyond Python coding. It explores the realms of:

- Data Science
- Data Analysis
- Python Programming
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebooks

Additionally, it involves web scraping and utilizes various libraries including requests, yfinance, BeautifulSoup, and plotly.
